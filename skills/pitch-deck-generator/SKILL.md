    --data company_data.yaml \
    --output pitch_deck_final.pptx
```

- **Lead with traction** - If metrics are strong, show early
- **Quantify everything** - Numbers build credibility
- **Tell a story** - Connect slides into a narrative

### Design
- **10-15 slides** - Respect investor time
- **Minimal text** - Headlines + visuals
- **Consistent branding** - Your colors, fonts
- **High-quality images** - No pixelated logos

### Delivery
- **PDF for email** - PPTX can break formatting
- **Practice 10+ times** - Know your deck cold
- **15-20 minute presentation** - Leave time for Q&A
