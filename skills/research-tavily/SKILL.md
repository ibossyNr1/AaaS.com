## 1. Usage

### A. Quick Fact Check (Basic)
Use this for simple queries like "Who is the CEO of Google?" or "Latest stock price of Apple".
```bash
python3 skills/research-tavily/scripts/tavily_search.py --query "Your Question Here" --depth "basic"
```

### B. Deep Dive (Advanced)
Use this for broad topics requiring comprehensive analysis. This mode takes longer but scrapes more sources.
```bash
python3 skills/research-tavily/scripts/tavily_search.py --query "Comprehensive analysis of AI Agent architectures in 2025" --depth "advanced"
```

## 2. API Key Requirement
This skill requires the `TAVILY_API_KEY` to be set in the `.env` file of the workspace. If it is missing, the script will fail gracefully and ask the user to provide it.
