# Remotion Best Practices

**PURPOSE:**
This skill acts as a knowledge base for "Remotion", the framework for creating videos in React.

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Composition
- Always define video metadata (width, height, fps) in `remotion.config.ts`.
- Use `<AbsoluteFill>` for layering components.

### 2. Rendering
- Prefer server-side rendering for production.
- Use `npx remotion render` for CLI output.

## 🛠️ Performance
- Use `useVideoConfig()` to access frame data.
- Optimize images using `remotion`'s built-in `Img` tag.
